# WireGuard Visual Configuration Editor - GUI Module

## Proof of Concept Status

This is the Phase 0 proof of concept implementation demonstrating:
- ✅ NiceGUI integration with Python backend
- ✅ Cytoscape.js graph visualization
- ✅ Basic node add/delete functionality
- ✅ Interactive graph manipulation
- ✅ Event handling between JavaScript and Python

## Architecture

```
wg_mesh_gen/gui/
├── __init__.py           # Module initialization
├── cytoscape_widget.js   # Vue.js component for Cytoscape
├── cytoscape_widget.py   # Python wrapper for NiceGUI
├── poc_app.py           # Proof of concept application
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Running the POC

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install nicegui
```

2. Run the POC application:
```bash
# From project root
python wg_mesh_gen/gui/poc_app.py

# Or using the test script
python test_gui_poc.py run
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

## Features Demonstrated

### Graph Visualization
- Interactive network topology display using Cytoscape.js
- Drag-and-drop node positioning
- Automatic layout algorithms (force-directed, circle, grid)
- Visual distinction for relay nodes (star shape, red color)

### Node Management
- Add nodes via form or by clicking on canvas
- Delete selected nodes
- Edit node properties (name, IP address)
- Role-based styling (client vs relay)

### Edge Management  
- Connect nodes by selecting two and clicking connect
- Different edge styles for different connection types
- Click edges to view properties
- Delete selected edges

### Event System
- Node click events
- Edge click events
- Canvas click events (for adding nodes)
- Drag end events
- Selection change events

### UI Components
- Responsive layout with panels
- Property editor for selected elements
- Status bar with current action feedback
- Collapsible property panel

## Technical Validation

The POC successfully demonstrates:

1. **JavaScript Integration**: Custom Vue component loads and runs Cytoscape.js
2. **Bidirectional Communication**: Python can call JS methods and receive events
3. **State Management**: Graph state is maintained in both Python and JavaScript
4. **UI Framework**: NiceGUI provides all needed UI components
5. **Performance**: Graph handles multiple nodes/edges smoothly

## Next Steps

With the POC validated, we can proceed to Phase 1:
- Define formal interfaces
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Implement proper data models
- Add state management with undo/redo
- Integrate with existing WireGuard config modules

## Known Limitations (POC)

- Simplified edge creation (need proper UI for source/target selection)
- No validation on IP addresses
- No persistence (refresh loses data)
- Basic property editing only
- No group management yet

These will be addressed in the full implementation.
